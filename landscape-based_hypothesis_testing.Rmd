## Introduction


## Learning goals

## Installing and loading the `FedData` package
```{r}
install.packages("FedData")
```

## Reading "site" locations from a table
```{r}
# Load cell tower location data straight from the internet using a URL path
cell_towers <- readr::read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bocinsky/r_tutorials/master/data/cell_towers.csv")

# Create a SpatialPointsDataFrame by adding coordinates
coordinates(cell_towers) <- ~longitude+latitude
# And set the projection information
proj4string(cell_towers) <- "+proj=longlat"

# Create a quick plot of the locations
leaflet(cell_towers) %>% 
  addTiles() %>%
  addMarkers(popup = ~htmlEscape(cid))
```

## Cropping to a study area


## Visualizing site locations

## Downloading landscape data with `FedData`

## Are sites situated based on soil type?

## Are sites situated based on elevation?

## Conclusions
